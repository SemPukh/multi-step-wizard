# Realization

Possibly asked qustion

As you could've noticed, I could have gotten all questions and display them 1 by 1, instead of getting new question every time we click 'next'.

It would probably be a better solution in terms of optimization, but as listed in the task:

<q>You could safely assume that each step is configured on the backend...</q>,

More than that, I use a certain order of questions that may vary in real app.
